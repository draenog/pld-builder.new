Roadmap:

  Makefile -- nothing interesting.

  PLD_Builder/ -- all python stuff live here.

  admin/ -- scripts for chroot admin.

  architektura.txt -- docs, in Polish.

  client/ -- scripts for clients, i.e. developers sending requests

  config/ -- configuration

  go.py -- testing script, don't touch

  src_builder/ -- scripts for srpms builder
  
    request-handler.sh
      Script to be run from procmail. It process incoming request, 
      authorizes it and stores in spool/queue.

    src-builder.sh
      Script to be run from cron. It looks for new requests in spool/queue,
      gets them from there, builds SRPM, and stores request for binary
      builders in spool/req_queue (which is mirrored in www/ directory,
      signed and compressed). SRPMS and buildlogs are queued for transmission.

  binary_builder/ -- scripts for binary builder

    request-fetcher.sh
      Fetch queue.gz from src-builder, and distribute requests for all
      builders hosted on given account (to spool/queue-<builder> files).

    rpm-builder.sh <builder>
      Tries to aquire locks for <builder> and for job-slot. If that suceeds, 
      proccess one request from spool/queue-<builder>.
  
Working directories:
  lock/
  spool/
  log/
