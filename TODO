- file-sender -- buildlogs, ftp queues. support for file://, scp://, rsync://
  remember to send files in order, they were stored

- load-balancer -- process got_lock, and run rpm-builder for archs in proper
  order, shorten got_lock
  
- make mailer.py actually send mail (easy)

- fix make-request.sh to be more user-friendly and configurable

- report time consumed by build

---- current builders functionality ends here ----

- store rpms in /spool/ready/ in chroot? (rpm_builder.py)

- sending reports from binary to src builder, so it can update its queue and
  clean srpms that ain't needed anymore
  
- deps install/uninstall machinery (hard stuff -- building deps tree already 
  done)

- if magic comment found in spec: single-build -- aquire all job-slots

- allow blocking some packages

- add possibility of tagging stuff for source builder

- fetch src.rpm once for all builders on this account, separate fetching 
  src.rpms, so we can build and fetch at the same time
